## 🗄️ Data Pipeline

| Step | Script | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| Extract from MySQL | `data_loader.py` | Raw DataFrames |
| Save raw CSVs | `data_saver.py` | `customers_raw.csv`, `credit_profiles_raw.csv`, `transactions_raw.csv` |
| Clean & preprocess | `preprocessors/` | `customers_processed.csv`, `credit_profiles_processed.csv`, `transactions_processed.csv` |

## 🎯 Target Segment — 18–25 Age Group

| Metric | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| Share of customer base | ~25% |
| Credit history | Low / None |
| Current CC usage | Low |
| Top spending categories | Electronics, Fashion, Beauty |

> **Conclusion:** This segment shows high growth potential with the right incentive-based campaign.

## 🚀 Campaign Design

A **2-month pilot campaign** was designed specifically for the 18–25 segment:

- 💰 Cashback on every transaction  
- 🎁 ₹200 welcome bonus  
- 🆓 Zero annual fee for Year 1  

**Pilot result:** 100 customers selected → **40% conversion rate**

---

## 🧪 A/B Testing & Hypothesis Testing

| | Control Group | Treatment Group |
|-|--------------|-----------------|
| Campaign offered | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Avg. daily transactions | Baseline | Significantly higher |
| Test used | Z-Test (two-proportion) | |
| Result | **Statistically significant** increase confirmed |

> The campaign successfully increased daily transaction volume at a 95% confidence level.
